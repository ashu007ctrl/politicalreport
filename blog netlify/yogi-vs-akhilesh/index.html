      <h2>Ideology and Vision</h2>
      <p><strong>Yogi Adityanath</strong> promotes Hindutva, emphasizing cultural nationalism and strong state control. His governance reflects discipline, nationalism, and religious pride.</p>
      <p><strong>Akhilesh Yadav</strong> leans toward socialism and secularism, focusing on digital India, youth employment, and welfare policies that include all communities.</p>

      <h2>Party Background</h2>
      <p><strong>BJP</strong> (Bharatiya Janata Party), led by Yogi in UP, emphasizes Hindu unity, development, and central leadership under PM Modi. It has a national presence and strategic vision.</p>
      <p><strong>SP</strong> (Samajwadi Party), founded by Mulayam Singh Yadav and now led by Akhilesh, champions social justice, regional identity, and farmer rights. It holds influence mostly in UP and nearby regions.</p>

      <h2>Leadership Journey</h2>
      <p><strong>Yogi Adityanath</strong> started as a Hindu monk and became MP from Gorakhpur in 1998. In 2017, he became CM of UP and was re-elected in 2022, breaking previous records.</p>
      <p><strong>Akhilesh Yadav</strong> studied abroad and began political life in the early 2000s. In 2012, he became the youngest CM of UP, promoting metro lines, laptop schemes, and IT parks.</p>

      <h2>Public Support and Criticism</h2>
      <p>Yogi is seen as bold and no-nonsense, especially admired for infrastructure and law enforcement. Critics say he is too religiously polarizing.</p>
      <p>Akhilesh is praised for his modern vision and calm demeanor. Critics point to weak law and order during his term and dependency on traditional caste alliances.</p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Both leaders have different strengths. Yogi Adityanath represents firm control and ideology, while Akhilesh Yadav reflects youth, technology, and inclusivity. The 2025 UP election will be a battle between these two approaches.</p>

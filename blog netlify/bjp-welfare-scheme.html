      <h1>BJP's Welfare Schemes: Transforming India</h1>
      <p><strong>Published Date :</strong> May 28, 2025</p>
      <p>The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has launched several welfare schemes aimed at improving the lives of Indian citizens. These initiatives address poverty alleviation, healthcare, infrastructure, women empowerment, and digital inclusion. Below are the most impactful schemes and their expanded details.</p>

      <h2>1. Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY)</h2>
      <p>Launched in 2016, this scheme provides free LPG connections to women from below poverty line (BPL) households. By reducing dependence on traditional cooking fuels like wood and coal, it improves health conditions and promotes clean energy.</p>
      <p>In recent years, the scheme has been expanded with refill subsidies and distribution centers in rural areas. PMUY has empowered women by saving their time and reducing exposure to harmful smoke, contributing to better family health and economic productivity.</p>

      <h2>2. Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY)</h2>
      <p>One of the world's largest healthcare programs, PMJAY provides health insurance coverage up to ₹5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization. Over 50 crore Indians are eligible for this cashless treatment facility.</p>
      <p>Ayushman Bharat has also established over 1.5 lakh Health & Wellness Centres to provide primary care, reducing the burden on hospitals. This scheme is a major step towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India.</p>

      <h2>3. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY)</h2>
      <p>PMAY aims to provide affordable housing for all by 2025. Beneficiaries receive subsidies on home loans and financial assistance for building or improving houses. The focus is on urban and rural poor, slum dwellers, and economically weaker sections.</p>
      <p>Over 3 crore houses have been sanctioned so far, many featuring eco-friendly construction technologies. PMAY promotes inclusive urban development and infrastructure growth.</p>

      <h2>4. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan</h2>
      <p>Launched in 2014, this cleanliness campaign aimed to eliminate open defecation and improve sanitation. Millions of toilets were constructed across rural and urban India, dramatically improving hygiene and reducing waterborne diseases.</p>
      <p>The program has also driven behavioral change through awareness campaigns and school programs. Swachh Bharat's success has enhanced India's global image and public health indicators.</p>

      <h2>5. PM-KISAN</h2>
      <p>The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme provides direct income support of ₹6,000 annually to small and marginal farmers in three equal installments. This ensures timely financial assistance for agricultural inputs and household needs.</p>
      <p>The scheme has benefited over 12 crore farmers so far, strengthening rural economies and boosting agricultural productivity.</p>

      <h2>6. Make in India</h2>
      <p>Make in India, launched in 2014, aims to transform India into a global manufacturing hub by encouraging domestic and foreign investment. It focuses on 25 sectors, including defense, electronics, and automobiles.</p>
      <p>This initiative has improved the ease of doing business, created jobs, and fostered innovation. Several multinational companies have set up production facilities in India, enhancing exports and reducing import dependency.</p>

      <h2>7. Digital India</h2>
      <p>Digital India promotes digital infrastructure, digital literacy, and e-governance. It has expanded internet access in rural areas, created platforms for digital payments, and made government services more transparent and efficient.</p>
      <p>Key initiatives include Aadhaar integration, Unified Payments Interface (UPI), and BharatNet. Digital India is bridging the urban-rural divide and empowering citizens through technology.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The BJP government has implemented several schemes targeting different sectors of society. These initiatives have improved healthcare, housing, sanitation, financial inclusion, and digital connectivity, contributing to India's overall development.</p>

  <h1>US Attack on Venezuela and Arrest of President</h1>
  <p><strong>Published Date:</strong> January 3, 2026</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    In a dramatic escalation of tensions, the <strong>United States launched a targeted military operation against Venezuela</strong> in early August 2025. 
    The operation culminated in the <strong>arrest of Venezuela’s sitting President</strong>, sending shockwaves across Latin America and the global political landscape.

  <h2>Why the US Took Action</h2>
  <p>
    According to US officials, the operation was carried out in response to allegations of 
    <strong>drug trafficking, human rights violations, election manipulation, and threats to regional stability</strong>. 
    Washington stated that diplomatic efforts had failed, leaving military intervention as a “last resort.”
  </p>

  <h2>Details of the Military Operation</h2>
  <p>
    The US conducted <strong>precision air and naval strikes</strong> targeting key military installations and command centers. 
    Within hours, elite forces reportedly detained the Venezuelan President and senior officials, transferring them to international custody.
  </p>

  <h2>Immediate Impact on Venezuela</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Nationwide protests and emergency curfews</li>
    <li>Temporary shutdown of airports and ports</li>
    <li>Severe pressure on the Venezuelan currency</li>
    <li>Disruptions in oil production and exports</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Global Reactions</h2>
  <p>
    The international response has been deeply divided. 
    Several Western allies expressed support for restoring democracy, while countries in 
    <strong>Latin America, Asia, and Europe condemned the move as a violation of sovereignty</strong>.
    Emergency sessions were called at the United Nations to address the crisis.
  </p>

  <h2>Impact on Global Oil Markets</h2>
  <p>
    Venezuela holds one of the world’s largest oil reserves. Following the attack, 
    <strong>global oil prices surged by nearly 4%</strong> amid fears of supply disruptions, 
    impacting energy-importing nations worldwide.
  </p>

  <h2>Future Outlook</h2>
  <p>
    The arrest of Venezuela’s President marks a turning point for the country. 
    Analysts predict a prolonged period of instability, potential international sanctions, 
    and the possibility of a transitional government under international supervision.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The US attack on Venezuela and the arrest of its President represent one of the most 
    significant geopolitical events of 2025. While supporters argue it could pave the way for democratic reforms, 
    critics warn it may deepen regional instability and set a dangerous global precedent.

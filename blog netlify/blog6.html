      <h1>Operation Sindoor</h1>
      <p><strong>Published Date : </strong> May 29, 2025</p>

      <p>On May 7, 2025, India launched <strong>Operation Sindoor</strong>, a series of precision military strikes targeting terrorist infrastructures in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. This decisive action was in direct response to the <strong>Pahalgam terror attack</strong> on April 22, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, predominantly Hindu pilgrims. The operation marks one of the most significant escalations between the two nuclear-armed neighbors in recent years.</p>

      <h2>Background: The Pahalgam Attack</h2>
      <p>The Pahalgam attack, attributed to the militant group <em>The Resistance Front</em>, a proxy of Lashkar-e-Taiba, involved a coordinated assault on a tourist convoy in Jammu and Kashmir. The brutality of the attack sent shockwaves across India, prompting immediate calls for a robust response. Intelligence reports indicated that the perpetrators had links to terror camps operating within Pakistani territory, necessitating a strategic military intervention.</p>

      <h2>Execution of Operation Sindoor</h2>
      <p>In the early hours of May 7, the Indian Armed Forces executed 24 precision missile strikes across nine identified terrorist camps located in regions including <strong>Bahawalpur</strong>, <strong>Muridke</strong>, <strong>Muzaffarabad</strong>, and <strong>Kotli</strong>. These locations are known strongholds of terror outfits such as <em>Jaish-e-Mohammed</em> and <em>Lashkar-e-Taiba</em>. The operation was meticulously planned, utilizing advanced weaponry to ensure minimal collateral damage.</p>

      <h2>Advanced Weaponry Deployed</h2>
      <p>The Indian Air Force deployed <strong>Rafale fighter jets</strong> equipped with <strong>SCALP cruise missiles</strong> and <strong>AASM HAMMER bombs</strong>. These precision-guided munitions allowed for targeted strikes on terrorist infrastructures while avoiding civilian casualties. The operation, lasting approximately 23 minutes, demonstrated India's enhanced military capabilities and commitment to counter-terrorism.</p>

      <h2>Casualties and Damage Assessment</h2>
      <p>According to Indian defense sources, the strikes resulted in the elimination of over <strong>70 terrorists</strong> and injuries to more than <strong>60 others</strong>. Key infrastructures, including training camps and ammunition depots, were destroyed, significantly crippling the operational capabilities of the targeted groups. Pakistan, however, reported civilian casualties, including the tragic death of a child, and condemned the strikes as an act of aggression.</p>

      <h2>Pakistan's Response and International Reactions</h2>
      <p>In retaliation, Pakistan claimed to have shot down five Indian fighter jets and initiated cross-border shelling, leading to further casualties on both sides. The Pakistani government labeled the operation as an "act of war" and called for international intervention. Global leaders, including the UN Secretary-General and officials from the United States and China, urged both nations to exercise restraint and engage in diplomatic dialogues to de-escalate tensions.</p>

      <h2>Strategic Implications</h2>
      <p>Operation Sindoor underscores India's strategic shift towards proactive defense measures against cross-border terrorism. The operation not only served as a punitive response but also as a deterrent against future attacks. It highlighted India's resolve to protect its citizens and sovereignty, sending a clear message to hostile entities operating beyond its borders.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>While Operation Sindoor achieved its immediate military objectives, it also brought to the forefront the fragile nature of India-Pakistan relations. The need for sustained diplomatic efforts and confidence-building measures remains paramount to ensure long-term peace and stability in the region.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>India's commitment to counter-terrorism is unwavering.</li>
        <li>Precision strikes demonstrate advanced military capabilities.</li>
        <li>Diplomatic channels must remain open to prevent further escalation.</li>
      </ul>
